## Introduction
I recently participated in the May 2025 ZoomCharts Mini Challenge, which is part of the global DataDNA Dataset Challenge organized by Onyx Data.

This month‚Äôs challenge focused on analyzing mobile phone sales data from 2024 ‚Äî a rich dataset covering product specifications, customer demographics, pricing, sales channels, and geographic locations across multiple countries.


## Problem Statement
*"You are a data analyst for a major mobile phone retailer operating across multiple countries. You‚Äôve been given a 2024 sales dataset, containing detailed records of mobile phone transactions, customer demographics, product specifications, and geographic locations. The dataset combines information about the models sold, their prices, storage sizes, colors, operating systems, and customer demographics like age group and gender. It also captures where and how the sales were made - online, through partners, or in-store, and the type of payment used.
Your goal is to build a report that tells the story of mobile sales across different regions, highlights best-selling products and trends, and helps the business understand customer behavior better."*

## Sales Dashboard Output

This dashboard helps the mobile sales team understand their customers, revenue trends, and performance gaps more clearly.

It provides actionable insights such as:

üîç The *26‚Äì33 age group contributed the highest total revenue ($2.93M)*, accounting for 19.68% of all revenue‚Äîhighlighting this group as a key customer segment to focus on.

üí∏ Most purchases happened via *Cash*, especially among consumers aged *26‚Äì33 and 34‚Äì42*, showing that offline payment methods still dominate.

üõçÔ∏è *OnePlus 12 Pro* was the *top-selling model*, contributing 21.65% of total units sold.

üì¶ *256GB storage and White color combinations generated the highest revenue*, making them the most popular configurations.

üåê The *Online channel* led all others with 61.63% of total revenue, showing the growing importance of digital sales.

üìÖ *January* was the best-performing month, generating $1.41M in revenue‚Äî135.48% higher than November, the lowest month.

## Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a .xlsx file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present.
- Step 5 : To clean the data, remove the duplicates from the dataset of "Fact_Sales".
- Step 6 : Update the header in 3 datasets as per requirement and load the dataset into Power BI.

### Page Set up
- Step 7 : To organise the report, at first text box is inseted in the report to write the TITLE of the page. Name the report as **"Mobile Sales Report"**.
- Step 8 : In the report view, under the insert tab, using image option company's logo was added to the report design area at the left corner. Here is visual outcome:
    ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ed1353e-606f-44af-b976-0c17e9d09b16)
- Step 9 : In order to navigate the report add the another three "Action" button as *"Revenue"*, *"Sales Insight"*, and *"Customer Insight"* at the right corner. 

    ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b2cac32-bccd-42f3-994a-fbc99aa0d0f4)
- Step 10 : Make the duplicate of the page for three times to create the separate Canvas for each part.
- Step 11 : Visual Slicers were added for three fields for "Country", "Storage Size", & "Months".

### Creating Measure Table:
To develop a dynamic Power BI report on Mobile Sales, I created a dedicated Measure Table to organize and centralize all the key DAX measures at one place.
for creating new Measures Table Table following DAX expression was written;
       
    MeasuresTable = 
    SELECTCOLUMNS(
        FILTER(
            { (1) },
            FALSE()
        ),
        "Measure", [Value]
    )

#### *Step 12: Used DAX expression in Measures Table*
- To calculate *Total Revenue*:

       Total Revenue = SUM(Fact_Sales[Total_Revenue])

- To calculate *Total Units Sold*:

       Total Units Sold = SUM(Fact_Sales[Units_Sold])

- To calculate *Average Order Value*:

      Average Order Value = [Total Revenue]/[Total Units Sold]

- To calculate MoM Revenue Change %:

      MoM Revenue Change % = 
      VAR CurrentMonthRevenue = [Total Revenue]
      VAR PreviousMonthRevenue =
          CALCULATE (
              [Total Revenue],
              DATEADD ( 'Fact_Sales'[Transaction_Date].[Date], -1, MONTH )
          )
      RETURN
          DIVIDE (CurrentMonthRevenue - PreviousMonthRevenue, PreviousMonthRevenue)

- To know total customer, male customer, female customer, and others consumers; count the rows of the customers gender:

      Total Consumer = COUNT(Fact_Sales[Customer_Gender])
        
      Male Consumer = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Fact_Sales), Fact_Sales[Customer_Gender]="Male")

      Female Consumer = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Fact_Sales), Fact_Sales[Customer_Gender]="Female")

      Others Consumer = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Fact_Sales), Fact_Sales[Customer_Gender]= "Other")

- To show the *Top Model Units Sold* as Text:

      Top Model Units Sold = 
      CALCULATE (
        MAX ( Fact_Sales[Mobile_Model] ),

            SUMMARIZE (
                Fact_Sales,
                Fact_Sales[Mobile_Model],
                "TotalUnits", SUM ( Fact_Sales[Units_Sold] )

              SUMMARIZE (
                  Fact_Sales,
                  Fact_Sales[Payment_Type],
                  "TotalUnits", SUM ( Fact_Sales[Units_Sold]       )
              ),
              [TotalUnits], DESC
          )
      )

- To show the *Top Selling Month* as Text:

      Top Selling Month = 
      CALCULATE (
          MAX ( Fact_Sales[End of Month].[Month] ),
          TOPN (
              1,
              SUMMARIZE (
                  Fact_Sales,
                  Fact_Sales[End of Month].[Month],
                  "TotalUnits", SUM ( Fact_Sales[Units_Sold] )      
              ),
              [TotalUnits], DESC
          )
      )

- To show the *Top Selling City* as Text:

              SUMMARIZE (
                  Fact_Sales,
                  Fact_Sales[City],
                  "TotalUnits", SUM ( Fact_Sales[Units_Sold] )
              ),
              [TotalUnits], DESC
          )
      )

- To show the *Top Selling Brand* as Text:

              'Fact_Sales'[Brand],
              "TotalUnits", SUM('Fact_Sales'[Units_Sold])
          )
      VAR TopBrand =

              ),
              [TotalUnits], DESC
          )
      )

### Revenue Report Page
The Revenue report page was designed to highlight key insights related to revenue performance following mobile sales, including total revenue, revenue trends, and contribution by product category.

- Step 13 : Four card visuals were added to the page to show MoM Revenue Change %, Average Order Value, Top Selling Brand and Top Model Units Sold (Top selling model)

    ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05ce63a3-6104-4651-88d2-2c2f0dcfece0)

- Step 14 : The line chart is implemented to analyze *Total Revenue over Time*, using Transaction Date (by month) on the X-axis and Total Revenue on the Y-axis. To provide the high-level summary, added card visual above the chart to display the *total revenue* amount of *$12.16 million*. Additionally, toggle on data labels through the Format pane to show monthly revenue values directly on the chart.

   *While highest revenue genarated in January, November gave the lowest.*

    ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebc5f3b7-96e0-4a62-8e66-380b47a0fefe)

- Step 15 : *Total Unit sold* insights were communicated using line chart with the transaction date formatted by month on the X-axis and total unit sold on the Y-axis. The total sold unit of 15.39K was shown through the card visual placed above the chart. From the Format panel, the data label option was toggled on to exhibit each month‚Äôs sold unit.
       
  *The chart revealed that the highest selling was in January 2024.*

    ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c717aa4-58f5-468b-98dd-bafa789ed114)

- Step 16 : A pie chart was implemented to illustrate *Total Revenue by Sales Channel*. The *Sales Channel* was selected for the category axis and *Total Revenue* for the value metric. This visual made it easy to identify which channels generated the highest revenue share.

  *It was observed that the Online channel generated the highest share of revenue.*

    ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a606c99-b4fb-4a61-a2d0-b5634b1be22d)

- Step 17 : *Total Genarated Revenue by Country* was visualized using a ZoomChart Drill Down Combo Bar. Countries were set as the category axis, and total revenue was selected as the series.  This chart enabled interactive exploration through drill-down features, allowing deeper insights into regional revenue performance.

  *Among all countries, India was identified as having the highest revenue contribution, while Pakistan recorded the lowest.*

    ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31a517ec-25df-47cc-ae70-84b47077e877)

- Step 18 : 
To analyze *Genarated Revenue by Color and Storage Size*, the heat map was added with Color on rows and Storage Size on columns, based on the Total Revenue measure. Green with 256GB recorded the highest value at $990.5K, followed closely by White (256GB) at $964.7K and Blue (128GB) at $922K. Notably, White (64GB) also contributed significantly with $938.6K. 

  *Overall, White emerged as the top-performing color, and 128GB was the most consistent storage size in terms of revenue.*

#### Sales Insight Report Page

This Sales Insight dashboard provides a clear view of sales performance, showcasing units sold by month, top mobile models, OS-wise pricing trends, and monthly OS unit sales.

- Step 19 : Four card visuals were added to the page to show top selling city, top selling channel, top payment method, top selling month.
  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09a74870-6f08-4391-8f5b-c54a3added9e)

- Step 20 : 5 Top Selling Mobile Model
A stacked bar chart was inserted to highlight the top five best-selling mobile models. The Y-axis was assigned to model names, and the X-axis was set to total units sold. The Top N filter was enabled for the model field, where ‚ÄúTotal Unit Sold‚Äù defined the ranking criteria. 

  *According to the total number of units sold, OnePlus 12 Pro was ranked 1st, followed by OnePlus 11R (2nd), OnePlus Nord 4 (3rd), Pixel 9 Pro (4th), and Galaxy S25 Ultra (5th).*

    ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd10c67a-86ba-4ab6-8d29-971bcbd49da9)

- Step 21 : A stacked bar chart was used to present the top 5 best-selling months. The Y-axis was set to the end-of-month date, while the X-axis displayed the total units sold. A "Top N" filter was applied to the mobile model using the "Total Unit Sold" value to extract the highest-performing months. 

  *January emerged as the top-selling month, followed by August.*

  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8bb473a-7cf2-4f87-8542-af2eeeed9043)

- Step 22 : Average price trends for iOS and Android were visualized using the line chart. End-of-month dates were placed on the X-axis and average price on the Y-axis. The operating system was used as a legend category.
 
  *The iOS line peaked in January and dipped to its lowest in June. Android, on the other hand, recorded its highest average price in July and the lowest in May.*

  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a10daccf-acd7-4969-a6a9-4cf1c9212e09)

- Step 23 : Sales performance by operating system was displayed through a line chart, with end-of-month dates on the X-axis and total unit sales on the Y-axis. The legend represented different operating systems.

   *Sales trends indicated iOS had its highest units sold in May and the lowest in January, while Android showed the highest in January and lowest in November.*

#### Customer Insight Report Page

This Customer Insight report highlights essential analytics on total consumers segmented by color and storage size, customer gender-based brand preferences, OS choices by age, revenue by age group, and preferred payment methods.

- Step 24 : Four card visuals were added to the page to show Total consumer, Male consumer, Female consumer and Other consumer.

   ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afea9c07-0fca-4b65-b0f2-b63f2bd9527e)

- Step 25 : Total consumer preference for mobile storage and color was visualized through a heat map, where color was set on the row axis and storage size on the column axis. The peak was noted for 64GB White (25 consumers), with 128GB Blue and 256GB Green both attracting 24 consumers. Black at 128GB followed with 23. 

  *White and Blue colors demonstrated the highest overall consumer preference, while 256GB showed consistent popularity across options.*

   ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a5b311a-5781-4c71-abaa-777e491246cb)

- Step 26 : A visual comparison of mobile brand preferences between genders was achieved using tornado chart. Brands were used as the group axis, with total unit sales as the metric. Customer gender was selected as the legend to differentiate between male and female buying patterns across various brands.

  *Males showed the highest preference for OnePlus (2,138 units), and the lowest for Google (671). For females, Xiaomi ranked highest (1,768), while OnePlus had the fewest units sold (1,315). OnePlus and Apple were most popular among males; Xiaomi and Samsung were preferred by females.*

    ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f735402-ac07-4c8a-a631-463253505294)

- Step 27 : To analyze operating system trends by age group, a 100% stacked bar chart was inserted. The X-axis featured customer age groups, and operating system types were visualized using color-coded segments. 

   *A clear preference for iOS was shown among individuals aged 50‚Äì57. In contrast, Android emerged as the dominant choice for the 34‚Äì41, 42‚Äì49, and 58‚Äì65 age ranges. Across all groups, Android was chosen more frequently than the average preference line.*

   ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f75743a-cb77-44eb-a687-5ed0a4de459c)

- Step 28 : Stacked bar chart was used to visualize revenue distribution across customer age groups. The X-axis displayed age ranges, while total revenue was plotted on the Y-axis.
 
  *The age group 26‚Äì33 recorded the highest revenue at $2.4 million followed closely by the 42‚Äì49 group with $2.3 million. The least revenue, $1.6 million, was observed from the 50‚Äì57 age group.*

   ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b8ea2e4-3611-4873-828d-4df275cd84e6)

- Step 29 : Payment type preferences by age group were visualized using a 100% stacked bar chart. Age groups were plotted along the X-axis, with payment types as legend and Y-axis categories. 

  *EMI was most preferred by the youngest group, while middle-aged groups leaned toward credit cards. Cash led among 26‚Äì33 and 58‚Äì65, and UPI showed maximum usage in the 50‚Äì57 age segment.*

    ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76b84c75-6d7c-42ab-b317-07e795f0c14d)

- Step 30 : Interactive insights were produced using the "Smart Narrative" feature in Power BI. This functionality was applied to generate auto-explanatory summaries based on the visual data. The insights were dynamically updated in response to filters and slicers, allowing for a more data-driven narrative throughout the report.

## Conclusion
January recorded the highest revenue and unit sales, while November was the weakest month. Online sales dominated, with India leading in total revenue and Pakistan contributing the least. OnePlus 12 Pro was the top-selling model, and white color with 128GB or 256GB storage were the most preferred configurations. Android was more popular across most age groups, while iOS saw stronger interest among users aged 50‚Äì57. Cash was the leading payment mode, especially for the 26‚Äì33 and 58‚Äì65 age groups. Overall, the 26‚Äì33 age group generated the highest revenue.


## Improvement Areas & Suggestions
### Revenue Imbalance Across Months:
Revenue peaks in January ($1.41M) but drops sharply in November ($600.7K). This inconsistency suggests that sales are overly dependent on seasonal or promotional periods. A more consistent marketing strategy and monthly sales planning can help balance revenue flow.

### Product Over-Dependence:
OnePlus 12 Pro accounts for 21.65% of total unit sales, making the business highly reliant on a single product. This concentration risk can affect overall performance if demand shifts. Diversifying product offerings and marketing other high-potential models is essential.

### Underperformance of Partner Channel:
While Online and Retail Store channels contribute significantly, the Partner Channel lags behind at just 11.85% of revenue. This channel has untapped potential. Strengthening partnerships, providing incentives, and better training can improve partner sales performance.

### Cash-Heavy Transactions:
Cash remains the most used payment method, especially for key age groups (26‚Äì33, 34‚Äì42). While this shows customer trust in cash, it may limit digital engagement and loyalty tracking. Introducing digital incentives or EMI options can promote secure, trackable transactions.

### Inconsistent Sales Volume Across Months:
While January recorded the highest number of units sold (1,202) and November the lowest (510), the sales volume across months is inconsistent. Only April, May, August, and February maintained above-average unit sales. To improve this, introduce product launches, offers, or bundling strategies to boost engagement during off-peak periods.

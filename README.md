## Introduction
I recently participated in the May 2025 ZoomCharts Mini Challenge, which is part of the global DataDNA Dataset Challenge organized by Onyx Data.

This month‚Äôs challenge focused on analyzing mobile phone sales data from 2024 ‚Äî a rich dataset covering product specifications, customer demographics, pricing, sales channels, and geographic locations across multiple countries.


## Problem Statement
*"You are a data analyst for a major mobile phone retailer operating across multiple countries. You‚Äôve been given a 2024 sales dataset, containing detailed records of mobile phone transactions, customer demographics, product specifications, and geographic locations. The dataset combines information about the models sold, their prices, storage sizes, colors, operating systems, and customer demographics like age group and gender. It also captures where and how the sales were made - online, through partners, or in-store, and the type of payment used.
Your goal is to build a report that tells the story of mobile sales across different regions, highlights best-selling products and trends, and helps the business understand customer behavior better."*
